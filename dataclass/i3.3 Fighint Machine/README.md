# Dataclass - Intro 3.3 - Fighting Machine

In this exercise you will revisit (again!) the fighting game that we have used over and over again. However, this time you will refactor your code according to the starter code that I have provided you.

### Rubric

- [ ] Application still works correctly
- [ ] `Game` and the provided function stubs are correctly implemented and used.

### Style Guide

- [ ] Code should be formatted with the replit auto-formatter.
- [ ] Variables should have meaningful names that accurately describe what they refer to.
- [ ] No sloppy/unnecessary/commented out code.
- [ ] Functions defined at the top of the file
- [ ] Application is implemented inside `main` function that is called inside `if __name__ == '__main__':`.
- [ ] Input is collected with input helper functions.
- [ ] Input helpers use validation functions that don't contain side effects and are tested thoroughly.
- [ ] Any significant pure logic is extracted and tested thoroughly.
- [ ] All functions have type annotations and pass the type checker.
